# Sales-Analysis-of-Online-Games

The objective is to analyze the trend in sales for various video games in different regions of the world. The increasing trend in online gaming can be attributed to factors such as the availability of free internet from providers and the widespread use of smartphones.
The impact of COVID-19 has also played a significant role in the exponential increase in the popularity of online games. Many people have downloaded games on their PCs, laptops, and mobile devices as a form of entertainment during the pandemic.

My task is to predict the sales of video games based on eight distinguishing factors that can influence sales. These factors can vary from game to game and may include aspects such as genre, platform, release year, rating, etc.
By doing exploratory data analysis, I uncover important insights and relationships within the data. This may involve analyzing the distribution of sales across different regions, identifying the top-selling games, examining the correlation between sales and various attributes, and exploring any other relevant patterns.
EDA techniques such as data visualization, summary statistics, and hypothesis testing can be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify the attributes that accurately predict sales in millions of units for a given game.
The key findings and insights obtained from the EDA process highlight the most influential factors affecting sales, identify any regional variations in game preferences, and provide recommendations or suggestions for game developers or companies to improve their sales strategies.
